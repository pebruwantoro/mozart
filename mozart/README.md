Hello world, welcome to the Mozart Project


* Rules of the game

1. Every Feature Create From Master
- Make sure your local master branch sync with origin master
`
$ git pull origin master
`

- Create New Branch Feature
`
$ git checkout -b <your_branch_feature>
`

2. Don't Forget to Commit and Push on Repository
`
$ git commit -am "messgae commit"
`

`
$ git push origin <your_branch>
`

3. Before Merge into Master Sync Your Branch Feature with Master
`
$ git pull origin master --rebase
`

4. If Any Conflicts, Please Resolve It

Good luck Comerads
